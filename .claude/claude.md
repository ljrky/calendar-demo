## Workflow

1. think through the problem. read the codebase and write a plan in tasks/todo.md
2. the plan should be checklist of todo items.
3. check in with me before starting work, i will verify the plan.
4. then, complete the todos one by one, marking them off as you go.
5. at every steop, give me a high-level explanation of what you changed.
6. keep every change simple and minimal. avoid big rewrites.
7. at the end, add a review section in todo.md summarizing the changes.
